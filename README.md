Challenge 1

On this URL, write a function that pulls the product price and currency from the DOM, then returns an object with the price as a number, and the currency as a currency code. Ie:

obj = {
  price: 19.99,
  currency: ‘USD’ 
}

Challenge 2

On this page, write a function that assigns a click handler to all the ‘Sign Up Now’ buttons on the page. The click handler should trigger an ‘alert’, with text that indicates which button was clicked. Ie:

‘Clicked button 1’, ‘Clicked button 2’, etc.

Challenge 3

On this page, write a function that attaches click listeners to all the buttons in the top menu (Nike, Yeezy, etc.). 

The click handler should first check whether or not a document cookie named ‘browserClick’ has been set on the page. If the cookie has not been set, the function should set the cookie to the text of the button clicked; if it has been set, the function should trigger an alert that displays the cookie value.
